            Hi! Welcome to my website which you've stumbled upon. My name is Austin Ye, an incoming junior studying Data Science in University of Michigan
            - Ann Arbor. My main academic interests include: Data Security, Data Analytics, and Machine Learning. Through my time
             in University, I've taken classes surrounding Machine Learning, Computer Security, and much more, check out my courses 
             tab for more information. 
          </p>

          <p class = "bio">Additionally, I have done a few side projects that I have been working on for a while, which you can find under my projects
            tab. </p>

          <p class = "bio">Beyond academics, I love to cook and try different things, some of my fondest memories are by copying recipes that I find on
            Masterchef. If you want to explore some of the things that I like to do for fun, check out my for fun tab where I include some pictures
           of trips I've taken or of things I have tried.</p>

          <p class = "bio">I hope you enjoy your stay on my website!</p>
