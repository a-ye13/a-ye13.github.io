          <h2>The Power of Habit By: Charles Duhigg</h2>
          My thoughts on the book: 
          <p class="book_review">
              This book encapsulates a lot of things that I enjoy. First, it includes many stories that I have read
               about and learned about through my classes and other interactions. For example, Duhigg talks about the 
               Target pregnancy situation, when their prediction model was so good that it revealed the pregnancy of 
               a teen girl to her own father.

        <h2>How to Win Friends and Influence People By: Dale Carnegie</h2>
        My thoughts on the book: 
        <p class="book_review">
            This book includes many interesting anecdotes to keep in mind when learning specific skills of how to make people 
            listen to you and how you can influence others. I think that this book is actually a beneficial read for anyone who wants to 
            learn more about how their words and actions can cause people to turn towards you as a leader or turn against you due to what you 
            do.

        <h2>Tech Titans of China: How China's Tech Sector is Challenging the World by Innovating Faster, Working Harder, and Going Global By: Rebecca Fannin</h2>
        My thoughts on the book: 
        <p class="book_review">
            This book was in an entirely different category than the other two books that I have read so far this summer. In this book it focuses 
            on how the Tech industry in China which has been dominated by Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent is growing and the startup culture is exploding 
            at rates faster than the US and other places globally. It was interesting to read through all of the different success stories that come with these 
            startups in China. My only complaint of the book is that it felt very biased, as I guess you could argue that it has to be, towards Chinese technology 
            and did not give United States companies the respect that they deserve for the effort they put in in innovating new technology and creating new advances 
            in spaces like AI and machine learning.

            <br>

            Overall, this is a great book that highlights many of the things that I'm sure lots of people are wondering about, it was written in 2019,
             so it actually includes some talk about the brewing trade war that has been coming in the recent couple years under the Trump Presidency. I would be interested 
             in seeing the next book in this series to see how this story between US - China plays out.

        <h2>The Effortless Experience: Conquering the New Battleground for Customer Loyalty By: Matthew Dixon, Nick Toman, and Rick Delisi</h2>
        My thoughts on the book: 
        <p class="book_review">
            This books includes many inside looks into how the customer experience landscape is changing through the years. From when 
            it was solely about the product, and customer service was just something of an afterthought, it is important now to measure it in 
            different ways than it was before. In this book, it lays out techniques like the Customer Effort Score, which focuses on scoring the 
            transactional nature of the customer service, and realizing whether or not customers were provided with the service that is perceived to be 
            of least effort. This is the future and the present of customer service, where self-service is king and the remaining phone calls are done 
            for extremely complex issues that are still not trusted in self-service. I would have loved some talk about how to best implement and 
            convince users towards giving self-service a shot. Additionally, I really appreciated how in the book, they provided many 
            case studies of companies that took their advice and stood to profit on it in very specific measures. That allows them to gain credibility 
            about the validity in their statements.

            This book was the reading material for my summer internship at General Motors that will be starting later this summer, I am excited to see 
            what things I can adapt from this book into General Motors, and how I can better the Customer Experience. I am looking forward to checking out 
            the mass amount of data that there is and shaping it to give us more insight into how the customer service industry in GM can be modified 
            and pushed towards the future!
