          <h2>The Power of Habit By: Charles Duhigg</h2>
          My thoughts on the book: 
          <p class="book_review">
              This book encapsulates a lot of things that I enjoy. First, it includes many stories that I have read
               about and learned about through my classes and other interactions. For example, Duhigg talks about the 
               Target pregnancy situation, when their prediction model was so good that it revealed the pregnancy of 
               a teen girl to her own father.

        <h2>How to Win Friends and Influence People By: Dale Carnegie</h2>
        My thoughts on the book: 
        <p class="book_review">
            This book includes many interesting anecdotes to keep in mind when learning specific skills of how to make people 
            listen to you and how you can influence others. I think that this book is actually a beneficial read for anyone who wants to 
            learn more about how their words and actions can cause people to turn towards you as a leader or turn against you due to what you 
            do.

        <h2>Tech Titans of China: How China's Tech Sector is Challenging the World by Innovating Faster, Working Harder, and Going Global By: Rebecca Fannin</h2>
        My thoughts on the book: 
        <p class="book_review">
            This book was in an entirely different category than the other two books that I have read so far this summer. In this book it focuses 
            on how the Tech industry in China which has been dominated by Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent is growing and the startup culture is exploding 
            at rates faster than the US and other places globally. It was interesting to read through all of the different success stories that come with these 
            startups in China. My only complaint of the book is that it felt very biased, as I guess you could argue that it has to be, towards Chinese technology 
            and did not give United States companies the respect that they deserve for the effort they put in in innovating new technology and creating new advances 
            in spaces like AI and machine learning.

            <br>

            Overall, this is a great book that highlights many of the things that I'm sure lots of people are wondering about, it was written in 2019,
             so it actually includes some talk about the brewing trade war that has been coming in the recent couple years under the Trump Presidency. I would be interested 
             in seeing the next book in this series to see how this story between US - China plays out.

        <h2>The Effortless Experience: Conquering the New Battleground for Customer Loyalty By: Matthew Dixon, Nick Toman, and Rick Delisi</h2>
        My thoughts on the book: 
        <p class="book_review">
            This books includes many inside looks into how the customer experience landscape is changing through the years. From when 
            it was solely about the product, and customer service was just something of an afterthought, it is important now to measure it in 
            different ways than it was before. In this book, it lays out techniques like the Customer Effort Score, which focuses on scoring the 
            transactional nature of the customer service, and realizing whether or not customers were provided with the service that is perceived to be 
            of least effort. This is the future and the present of customer service, where self-service is king and the remaining phone calls are done 
            for extremely complex issues that are still not trusted in self-service. I would have loved some talk about how to best implement and 
            convince users towards giving self-service a shot. Additionally, I really appreciated how in the book, they provided many 
            case studies of companies that took their advice and stood to profit on it in very specific measures. That allows them to gain credibility 
            about the validity in their statements.

            <br>

            This book was the reading material for my summer internship at General Motors that will be starting later this summer, I am excited to see 
            what things I can adapt from this book into General Motors, and how I can better the Customer Experience. I am looking forward to checking out 
            the mass amount of data that there is and shaping it to give us more insight into how the customer service industry in GM can be modified 
            and pushed towards the future!

        <h2>Leadership and Self-Deciption By: The Arbinger Institute</h2>
        My thoughts on the book: 
        <p class="book_review">
            This book was written in a way that I really enjoyed because of the fictional side of it. It made it very easy to 
            read and enjoy, and it focused on a lot of interesting concepts that could be beneficial to my career or my personal life. 
            My biggest complaint about the book is that, some of the things that it tried to talk about and emphasize on were hard to 
            understand. For example, reading through the chapters on getting out of the box, I still don't quite understand what they were saying 
            about how that is done. They mentioned how it is something that is felt, and when you feel like getting out of the box then you will 
            but that doesn't really make sense.

            <br>

            Otherwise, I think that this book was super easy to read, given that I was able to read it in about 2 days, and it provided some 
            interesting ideas that I can think about later on in applicable situations. I love reading books that let me reflect on things that I do 
            as a person, in my personal or professional life. This book really allowed me to think back on whether I was in the box with the people 
            that I love or not.

        <h2>Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time: Howard Schultz and Dori Jones Yang</h2>
        My thoughts on the book: 
        <p class="book_review">
            This book was a very interesting look into the inner growth of one of the greatest companies of this generation or previous 
            generation. It included insight into Howard Schultz as he grew up as a kid in the Projects, into the CEO of a multi-billion dollar business. Reading 
            this now, more than 20 years after this book was published, a lot of the things he mentions still ring true in my mind, such as: 
            the importance of putting your employees above all, and focusing on internal growth first before you move towards pleasing the customer. That is 
            one belief that I have held for much of my life. Throughout this entire book, I loved to read about his little stories of how Starbucks 
            was struggling and how he was able to overcome them through his efforts with his team. I thoroughly enjoyed reading about his work with 
            the people that he brought in to help him run Starbucks. One of the biggest things that I took away from this book was when Howard Schultz mentioned that 
            he only hires people who have done things before and people he can learn from. He also mentions how as an entrepreneur, that is one of 
            the scariest things to do, because you begin to resign control over aspects of your company. 

            <br>

            Throughout reading this book, I was able to get invaluable insight into how a company was built on common values, and how Howard was able to 
            motivate so many people on his team to believe in his vision. I also felt very inspired hearing about his beginnings and how he was able to 
            defy all odds and get to the place that he is at. My only complaint for the book was that at times, it felt like Howard was beginning to rant about how 
            he was sad or angry that people viewed Starbucks in a certain way, without understanding why that came to be. It showed his humanity, which I appreciated 
            but in a memoir I would have hoped to see some introspection into reasons behind those general feelings from the public.
