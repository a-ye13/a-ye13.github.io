          <h2>The Power of Habit By: Charles Duhigg</h2>
          My thoughts on the book: 
          <p class="book_review">
              This book encapsulates a lot of things that I enjoy. First, it includes many stories that I have read
               about and learned about through my classes and other interactions. For example, Duhigg talks about the 
               Target pregnancy situation, when their prediction model was so good that it revealed the pregnancy of 
               a teen girl to her own father.

        <h2>Tech Titans of China: How China's Tech Sector is Challenging the World by Innovating Faster, Working Harder, and Going Global By: Rebecca Fannin</h2>
        My thoughts on the book: 
        <p class="book_review">
            This book was in an entirely different category than the other two books that I have read so far this summer. In this book it focuses 
            on how the Tech industry in China which has been dominated by Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent is growing and the startup culture is exploding 
            at rates faster than the US and other places globally. It was interesting to read through all of the different success stories that come with these 
            startups in China. My only complaint of the book is that it felt very biased, as I guess you could argue that it has to be, towards Chinese technology 
            and did not give United States companies the respect that they deserve for the effort they put in in innovating new technology and creating new advances 
            in spaces like AI and machine learning.

            <br>

            Overall, this is a great book that highlights many of the things that I'm sure lots of people are wondering about, it was written in 2019,
             so it actually includes some talk about the brewing trade war that has been coming in the recent couple years under the Trump Presidency. I would be interested 
             in seeing the next book in this series to see how this story between US - China plays out.

        <h2>The Effortless Experience: Conquering the New Battleground for Customer Loyalty By: Matthew Dixon, Nick Toman, and Rick Delisi</h2>
        My thoughts on the book: 
        <p class="book_review">
            This books includes many inside looks into how the customer experience landscape is changing through the years. From when 
            it was solely about the product, and customer service was just something of an afterthought, it is important now to measure it in 
            different ways than it was before. In this book, it lays out techniques like the Customer Effort Score, which focuses on scoring the 
            transactional nature of the customer service, and realizing whether or not customers were provided with the service that is perceived to be 
            of least effort. This is the future and the present of customer service, where self-service is king and the remaining phone calls are done 
            for extremely complex issues that are still not trusted in self-service. I would have loved some talk about how to best implement and 
            convince users towards giving self-service a shot. Additionally, I really appreciated how in the book, they provided many 
            case studies of companies that took their advice and stood to profit on it in very specific measures. That allows them to gain credibility 
            about the validity in their statements.

            <br>

            This book was the reading material for my summer internship at General Motors that will be starting later this summer, I am excited to see 
            what things I can adapt from this book into General Motors, and how I can better the Customer Experience. I am looking forward to checking out 
            the mass amount of data that there is and shaping it to give us more insight into how the customer service industry in GM can be modified 
            and pushed towards the future!

        <h2>Leadership and Self-Deciption By: The Arbinger Institute</h2>
        My thoughts on the book: 
        <p class="book_review">
            This book was written in a way that I really enjoyed because of the fictional side of it. It made it very easy to 
            read and enjoy, and it focused on a lot of interesting concepts that could be beneficial to my career or my personal life. 
            My biggest complaint about the book is that, some of the things that it tried to talk about and emphasize on were hard to 
            understand. For example, reading through the chapters on getting out of the box, I still don't quite understand what they were saying 
            about how that is done. They mentioned how it is something that is felt, and when you feel like getting out of the box then you will 
            but that doesn't really make sense.

            <br>

            Otherwise, I think that this book was super easy to read, given that I was able to read it in about 2 days, and it provided some 
            interesting ideas that I can think about later on in applicable situations. I love reading books that let me reflect on things that I do 
            as a person, in my personal or professional life. This book really allowed me to think back on whether I was in the box with the people 
            that I love or not.

        <h2>Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time: Howard Schultz and Dori Jones Yang</h2>
        My thoughts on the book: 
        <p class="book_review">
            This book was a very interesting look into the inner growth of one of the greatest companies of this generation or previous 
            generation. It included insight into Howard Schultz as he grew up as a kid in the Projects, into the CEO of a multi-billion dollar business. Reading 
            this now, more than 20 years after this book was published, a lot of the things he mentions still ring true in my mind, such as: 
            the importance of putting your employees above all, and focusing on internal growth first before you move towards pleasing the customer. That is 
            one belief that I have held for much of my life. Throughout this entire book, I loved to read about his little stories of how Starbucks 
            was struggling and how he was able to overcome them through his efforts with his team. I thoroughly enjoyed reading about his work with 
            the people that he brought in to help him run Starbucks. One of the biggest things that I took away from this book was when Howard Schultz mentioned that 
            he only hires people who have done things before and people he can learn from. He also mentions how as an entrepreneur, that is one of 
            the scariest things to do, because you begin to resign control over aspects of your company. 

            <br>

            Throughout reading this book, I was able to get invaluable insight into how a company was built on common values, and how Howard was able to 
            motivate so many people on his team to believe in his vision. I also felt very inspired hearing about his beginnings and how he was able to 
            defy all odds and get to the place that he is at. My only complaint for the book was that at times, it felt like Howard was beginning to rant about how 
            he was sad or angry that people viewed Starbucks in a certain way, without understanding why that came to be. It showed his humanity, which I appreciated 
            but in a memoir I would have hoped to see some introspection into reasons behind those general feelings from the public.

        <h2>Predictably Irrational, Revised and Expanded Edition: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions: Dan Ariely</h2>
        My thoughts on the book: 
        <p class="book_review">
          This book included some of the most profound ideas that I have come to read this summer. It reminded me a lot of The Power of Habit (See Above), 
          but it also included a ton of other ideas that I never really thought about. I think that one of the coolest things about this book is that 
          a lot of things that it mentions are decisions and situations that I have personally come across or seen people go through in my life. I found it 
          quite intriguing when I read the name of each chapter and the central question for each study and determined what I would do if I was in that situation, 
          and it would quite enlightening to see that my thoughts of what I would do for a grand majority, actually fell into the general trend of how humans are 
          innately irrational.

          <br>

          Beyond just the surveys, I thought it was amazing to think about how these new insights will impact my life and the future after being aware of these things. 
          He does mention in the last chapter that the realization leaves us some options, even though we are all part of life where we all seem to not have as much 
          control as we all feel or believe that we do. However, I still am of the belief that after reading this book and thinking it through, that people will be able to 
          at least be aware of the irrational nature that they act under.

        <h2>How to Win Friends and Influence People By: Dale Carnegie</h2>
        My thoughts on the book: 
        <p class="book_review">
            This book includes many interesting anecdotes to keep in mind when learning specific skills of how to make people 
            listen to you and how you can influence others. I think that this book is actually a beneficial read for anyone who wants to 
            learn more about how their words and actions can cause people to turn towards you as a leader or turn against you due to what you 
            do.

            <br>

            Overall, through the three parts, I actually feel like a lot of it is applicable in a number of situations. Another part that I think was 
            quite crazy was that I feel like a lot of the techniques that he mentions, I have actually subconciously been doing. For example, the idea of 
            convincing someone that they want to do something that I want them to do is something that is done quite often to ease the blow when telling someone 
            to do something without building resentment.

        <h2>The Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking By: Dale Carnegie</h2>
        My thoughts on the book: 
        <p class="book_review">

            This book was the second one by Dale Carnegie that I read this summer, similarly to the book about influencing people, 
            this book includes a lot of same charm that Dale Carnegie has with his words. He includes many many examples that showcase the 
            effectiveness of the techniques that he talks about. In this book he also mentioned much more about things that you should not do 
            while speaking, while also relating it back to normal everyday conversation.

            <br>

            I think my favorite part of this book was his last chapter talking about how to apply these techniques. In his other book that I read, I feel 
            like that was one part that was lacking. However, in this book, he mentions a ton of examples from the classes that he taught in terms of success 
            stories and also about how to put these techniques into use in everyday conversation. If I am being honest, I am not sure if I will be able to remember 
            to use these techniques in everyday conversation or even in a speech context, but it was an interesting read and led to some intriguing thoughts that 
            I will consider to ponder as I go about growing as a public speaker.

        <h2>Mindset Secrets for Winning By: Mark Minervini</h2>
        My thoughts on the book: 
        <p class="book_review">
            This book was a beautiful look into how a great performer can dismiss the environment around them and allow habit or perfect 
            practice to take over. For me, as an athlete in high school and now working to become more confident in myself as I go into public 
            speaking or any other activity, this book was super interesting in teaching me steps that I could take to become a more "winning" version 
            of myself. There are a couple important things that I learned while reading the book, such as the importance of quieting the negative 
            backdrop that occurs right before your performance begins, and many other things that come with perfect practice. The important thing is 
            imagining that you are a winner, BEFORE you become a winner, it's not the other way around.

            <br>

            This book was able to get me to think and imagine about what I wish I could do and how I can get there through my own imagination and belief. 
            I will definitely try to put to use some of the practices in this book.
